# Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code of my portfolio website [eddy-quiel.online](https://eddy-quiel.online).


 - The code for the skill bars comes from [this code example](https://codepen.io/kundankumarmourya/pen/EOLoda) by Kundan
   Kumar Mourya and was heavily modefied. 
 - The [plyr media player](https://plyr.io/) is used for video
   playback.
 - [Formspark](https://formspark.io/) is used to send forms to my email without having to reveal my address in the code
 - [Botpoison](https://botpoison.com/) is used to keep bots from submitting forms

I am not affiliated with any of the listed services, this list exists to communicate my choices and might be changed in the future.
